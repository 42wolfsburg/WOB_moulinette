This is a reverse engineering test!
You will have a string for input and an int for output.
Your mission is to find the purpose and to code a program that will solve the problem

Bonus:
+50 for the fastest
+50 for the shortest code (you canÂ´t have both bonus)

The function will be prototyped as follows:
long int    ft_reverse(char *s);

Rendu:
Norminette mandatory
Program in C only
No tricks or traps : input will always be valid

Examples:
Input           ***         Output

"1111"          ***         -15
"1010101010"    ***         -682
"0"             ***         0
"10"            ***         -2
